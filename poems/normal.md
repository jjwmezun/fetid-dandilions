boring bill thinking he’s fill o’ the till\
pushing all his pills into our tongues\
thinking he’s younger than the sun\
thinking he’s too gun for buns without sesame seeds\
callin’ me jeeves when i don’t please\
speakin’ he false got null fleas pease\
porridge in the pot\
not past expiration date jake
